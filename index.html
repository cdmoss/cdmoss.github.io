                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Subjectively, Bitcoin is many things.</p> 
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>To some, it is a speculative monetary asset that is used to try to make huge returns.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>To others, it is a fascinating, technically impressive software program made by a mysterious. anonymous online entity.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>And to others still, it is a dangerous tool used by crooks to carry out shady criminal activity - or an energy hungry digital organism that threatens the environment.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>What bitcoin is, objectively, is an <strong>open source</strong>, <strong>permissionless</strong>, <strong>peer-to-peer</strong>, <strong>monetary network protocol</strong>.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3 align="center">... What does that mean?</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The above sentence is somewhat dense, so let's go through it one term at a time.</p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <p>When something is <strong>open source</strong>, it means that it is not built by a central, owning entity (which would be closed source). Instead, contributions to its development is a collaborative effort from anyone interested enough to offer their time and skills.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Permissionless</strong> is pretty clear - no one needs any permission to use it, it is open to anyone and everyone.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Peer-to-peer</strong> means that there is no central authority that decides the state of Bitcoin. Everyone who uses is on equal footing </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>A <strong>monetary network</strong> is money - it's an object or set of objects that everyone agrees can be traded for items of value. The US dollar is a monetary network, as is evey other country's legal tender. But other monetary networks can be cigarettes in jail, or gold, or seashells in more primitive cultures</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>A <strong>protocol</strong> is a system of rules that governs the transmission of information.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>So, what is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a digital, collaboratively maintained money which cannot be controlled by any one party and is available for anyone with an internet connection to use.</p>
