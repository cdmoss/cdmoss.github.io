                        <h3>Bitcoin as a Battery</h3>
                        <p>There are a subset of Bitcoin proponents who believe Bitcoin has the capacity to act as a "battery" of sorts. The view is based on the fact that there is a huge amount of waste energy produced which we do not have sufficient battery resources to capture and store. Bitcoin, then, could act as an alternative destination for this wasted energy. An overproducing powerplant could divert its surplus into Bitcoin mining rigs, then the network converts the unused electrical energy into economic energy since the Bitcoins generated would ostensibly would drive human productivity - given that Bitcoins maintain their worth as an asset.</p>

                        <h3>Bitcoin as a Monetary Lifeboat</h3>
                        <p>Many Bitcoin supporters believe that Bitcoin has the power to be a powerful, censorship resistant, inflation resistant store of value. They view the existing, fiat based system as hopelessly flawed due to being irresponsibly managed by the powers that be. Many currencies across the world are seeing rapid inflation - with the most extreme cases such as Lebanon, Venezuela, or Argentina seeing rates from 88% (Argentina) to 162% (Lebanon). They are also worried that the new fleet of digital currencies, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), pose a great threat to individual sovereignty, citing China's extreme surveillance state as an omen of what's to come if a privacy respecting money isn't adopted.</p>

                        <h3>Bitcoin as a Driver for Technological Advancement</h3>
                        <p>Bitcoin supporting technologists tend to believe that Bitcoin has the power to greatly speed up humanity's technological progress. They believe that Bitcoin's permissionless, global reach can provide many dormant, talented individuals with the means to innovate and generate economic prosperity. They also point out Bitcoin's capability, as a software program, to be augmented - there have already been a large amount of Bitcoin Improvement Protocol (BIP) upgrades that address security vulnerabilities, usability pain points, and other features added to Bitcoin. There are have also been applications built on top of the Bitcoin network like the Lightning Network: a payment system that handles payments off of the main Bitcoin chain, transforming Bitcoin from a relatively slow payment system at 7 transactions per second to the fastest payment network in existence at 1 million transactions per second. Bitcoin also has driven computer hardware technology forward, since miners compete by using the fastest hardware possible to increase their chances of receiving Bitcoin rewards.</p>

                        <h3>Bitcoin as an Environmental Cleanup Tool</h3>
                        <p>Bitcoin supporters often try to combat criticisms that Bitcoin is a wasteful system that only causes pollution by citing companies such as Upstram: a company that installs Bitcoin mining rigs which captures waste flare gas from oil and gas plants. They also make the case that Bitcoin can be used at any stranded energy source like Volcanos, stranded Geothermal Hotspots, and any other source of natural energy source that is otherwise unnaccessible by society; and channels that energy into the economy.</p>
