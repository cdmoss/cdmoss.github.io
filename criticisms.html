                        <h3>Bitcoin as a Tool for Crime</h3>
                        <p>Early in its life, Bitcoin was mostly known as a shady online money used to buy illicit products online. That reputation has clung to it, and it is still used due to its anonymous properties and its wide reach. Extremely prominent financial figures like Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger have condemned Bitcoin for its use in illegal activity.</p>

                        <h3>Bitcoin as an Environmental Hazard</h3>
                        <p>Bitcoin's method of securing the network, proof of work, is solely based on who can execute the most computations the fastest. This does lead to large energy usage, with notorious observations such as Bitcoin using more energy than the entire country of Argentina. In the face of anthropomorphic climate change and a more environmentally conscious global society which is hyper sensitive to pollutive technologies, the detractors of Bitcoin vow that it will never succeed due to this property alone.</p>

                        <h3>Bitcoin as a Money Sink</h3>
                        <p>Many have criticised Bitcoin for not having any intrinsic value. Traditional sound money proponents point to gold as a far superior asset due to its usage in dentistry and computer hardware. Furthermore technologists see Bitcoin as an outdated technology, and point to newer cryptographic projects like Ethereum and NFTs, which have been used to empower creators to make money through more independent channels.</p>

                        <h3>Bitcoin as an Underperforming System</h3>
                        <p>Many detractors of Bitcoin criticize underwhelming aspects like slow transaction speed, the wasteful validation method of proof of work, and the cumbersome process it must undertake in order for any upgrades to be added (the majority of network validators must agree to implement the change). They believe these things prevent it from adapting to the rapidly changing global financial landscape. They also point out that projects like the Lightning network, a second layer application that improves transactions speed, has many bugs and security vulnerabilities that make it an unreliable option for Bitcoin payments.<p>
